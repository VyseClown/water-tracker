<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

On the main screen you have three buttons, one for a cup of water, another for a bottle of water and a third one where you can input any amount of water you want. The point of these is to make it as quick and easy as possible to track your water intake after drinking ie. a glass of water. You can customize the corresponding volumes of the cup and the bottle to match your own in the settings of the app.
